Delaware,1,population projections to 2050,,,,"I am not really clear on the scope of your interest. As far as tools we use the usual suspects SPSS, SAS, Stata, R, Excel. When required we use Python. We regularly use Public Health's data for vital statistics at the individual level and are required to sign security agreements to use it. These are central to the detailed population projections to 2050 we update annually. The same can be said for hospital discharge data. We do long term enrollment projections for all the school districts and have access to student files for modelling purposes with restrictions and compliance with FERPA. We also assist the school districts with school attendance zone mapping working with the boards and with full access to the property records held by our three counties. That data also assists in annually determining the current property values within each district which are not regularly updated. Those data are  
also used when estimating the economic impact of the remediation of brownfields over time and also for general economic development evaluation of state ""investments"". We gain access to the state's accident data when we are looking at pedestrian and bicyclist involvement. The same can be said when investigating issues of substance abuse or evaluating the success or failure of programs dealing with teen drivers.we fairly regularly evaluate bluetooth data collected by DelDOT, the transportation agency and we use DelDOL Department of Labor as a source for locations and employment of workers. We also do original data collection for DelDOT on Origin and Destinations of trips by drivers for a variety of purposes. Along with these State/County purposes we regularly use the Current Population Survey, the American Community Survey, the BRFSS surveys conducted annually by most states for CDC, and the Census Data Center which provides detailed information on-line. Hope this helps a bit. Ed     "

·        Kansas Regional Data Portal (https://ipsr.ku.edu/sdc/region.php).  Application designed with and for our Economic Development Districts to assist them in completing their Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy (CEDS) reports.
I use a variety of state sources, but our state lacks data tools.  Most state agencies publish data only in PDF which requires some effort to liberate and make usable for local governments.  I hope this helps!  Please let me know if you have any questions.
