All statutes of this State in effect on February 17, 1972, re-quiring, authorizing, imposing, or relating to the death penalty are in full force and effect, subject to legislative amendment or repeal by statute, ini-tiative, or referendum. The death penalty provided for under those statutes shall not be deemed to be, or to constitute, the infiction of cruel or unusual punishments with-in the meaning of Article 1, Section 6 nor shall such punishment for such offenses be deemed to contravene any other provision of this constitution. [New section adopted November 7, 1972. Initiative measure.] [“The Victims’ Bill of Rights”] SEC. 28. (a) The People of the State of California fnd and declare all of the following: (1) Criminal activity has a serious impact on the citizens of California. The rights of victims of crime and their families in criminal prosecutions are a subject of grave statewide concern. (2) Victims of crime are entitled to have the criminal justice system view criminal acts as serious threats to the safety and welfare of the people of California. The enactment of comprehensive provisions and laws ensur-ing a bill of rights for victims of crime, including safeguards in the crimi-nal justice system fully protecting those rights and ensuring that crime victims are treated with respect and dignity, is a matter of high public im-portance. California’s victims of crime are largely dependent upon the proper functioning of government, upon the criminal justice system and upon the expeditious enforcement of the rights of victims of crime de-scribed herein, in order to protect the public safety and to secure justice when the public safety has been compromised by criminal activity. (3) The rights of victims pervade the criminal justice system. These rights include personally held and enforceable rights described in para-graphs (1) through (17) of subdivision (b). (4) The rights of victims also include broader shared collective rights that are held in common with all of the People of the State of California and that are enforceable through the enactment of laws and through good-faith efforts and actions of California’s elected, appointed, and publicly employed offcials. These rights encompass the expectation shared with all of the people of California that persons who commit felonious acts caus-ing injury to innocent victims will be appropriately and thoroughly inves-tigated, appropriately detained in custody, brought before the courts of California even if arrested outside the State, tried by the courts in a timely manner, sentenced, and suffciently punished so that the public safety is protected and encouraged as a goal of highest importance. (5) Victims of crime have a collectively shared right to expect that per-sons convicted of committing criminal acts are suffciently punished in both the manner and the length of the sentences imposed by the courts of the State of California. This right includes the right to expect that the puni-tive and deterrent effect of custodial sentences imposed by the courts will not be undercut or diminished by the granting of rights and privileges to prisoners that are not required by any provision of the United States Con-stitution or by the laws of this State to be granted to any person incarcer-ated in a penal or other custodial facility in this State as a punishment or correction for the commission of a crime. (6) Victims of crime are entitled to fnality in their criminal cases. Lengthy appeals and other post-judgment proceedings that challenge criminal convictions, frequent and diffcult parole hearings that threaten to release criminal offenders, and the ongoing threat that the sentences of criminal wrongdoers will be reduced, prolong the suffering of crime vic-tims for many years after the crimes themselves have been perpetrated. This prolonged suffering of crime victims and their families must come to an end. (7) Finally, the People fnd and declare that the right to public safety ex-tends to public and private primary, elementary, junior high, and senior high school, and community college, California State University, Univer-sity of California, and private college and university campuses, where stu-dents and staff have the right to be safe and secure in their persons. (8) To accomplish the goals it is necessary that the laws of California relating to the criminal justice process be amended in order to protect the legitimate rights of victims of crime. (b) In order to preserve and protect a victim’s rights to justice and due process, a victim shall be entitled to the following rights: (1) To be treated with fairness and respect for his or her privacy and dig-nity, and to be free from intimidation, harassment, and abuse, throughout the criminal or juvenile justice process. (2) To be reasonably protected from the defendant and persons acting on behalf of the defendant. (3) To have the safety of the victim and the victim’s family considered in fxing the amount of bail and release conditions for the defendant. (4) To prevent the

they suffer. (B) Restitution shall be ordered from the convicted wrongdoer in every case, regardless of the sentence or disposition imposed, in which a crime victim suffers a loss. (C) All

retained attorney of a victim, a lawful representa-tive of the victim, or the prosecuting attorney upon request of the victim, may enforce the rights enumerated in subdivision (b) in any trial or appel-late court with jurisdiction over the case as a matter of right. The court shall act promptly on such a request. (2) This section does not create any cause of action for compensation or damages against the State, any political subdivision of the State, any off-cer, employee, or agent of the State or of any of its political subdivisions, or any offcer or employee of the court. (d) The granting of these rights to victims shall not be construed to deny or disparage other rights possessed by victims. The court in its discretion may extend the right to be heard at sentencing to any person harmed by the defendant. The parole authority shall extend the right to be heard at a pa-role hearing to any person harmed by the offender. (e) As used in this section, a “victim” is a person who suffers direct or threatened physical, psychological, or fnancial harm as a result of the commission or attempted commission of a crime or delinquent act. The term “victim” also includes the person’s spouse, parents, children, sib-lings, or guardian, and includes a lawful representative of a crime victim who is deceased, a minor, or physically or psychologically incapacitated. The term “victim” does not include a person in custody for an offense, the accused, or a person whom the court fnds would not act in the best inter-ests of a minor victim. (f) In addition to the enumerated rights provided in subdivision (b) that are personally enforceable by victims as provided in subdivision (c), vic-tims of crime have additional rights that are shared with all of the People of the State of California. These collectively held rights include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) Right to Safe Schools. All students and staff of public primary, ele-mentary, junior high, and senior high schools, and community colleges, colleges, and universities have the inalienable right to attend campuses which are safe, secure and peaceful. (2) Right to Truth-in-Evidence. Except as provided by statute hereafter enacted by a two-thirds vote of the membership in each house of the Leg-islature, relevant evidence shall not be excluded in any criminal proceed-ing, including pretrial and post conviction motions and hearings, or in any trial or hearing of a juvenile for a criminal offense, whether heard in juve-nile or adult court. Nothing in this section shall affect any existing statu-tory rule of evidence relating to privilege or hearsay, or Evidence Code Sections 352, 782 or 1103. Nothing in this section shall affect any existing statutory or constitutional right of the press. (3) Public Safety Bail. A person may be released on bail by suffcient sureties, except for capital crimes when the facts are evident or the pre-sumption great. Excessive bail may not be required. In setting, reducing or denying bail, the judge or magistrate shall take into consideration the pro-tection of the public, the safety of the victim, the seriousness of the offense charged, the previous criminal record of the defendant, and the probability of his or her appearing at the trial or hearing of the case. Public safety and the safety of the victim shall be the primary considerations. A person may be released on his or her own recognizance in the court’s discretion, subject to the same factors considered in setting bail. Before any person arrested for a serious felony may be released on bail, a hearing may be held before the magistrate or judge, and the prosecuting attorney and the victim shall be given notice and reasonable opportunity to be heard on the matter. When a judge or magistrate grants or denies bail or release on a person’s own recognizance, the reasons for that decision shall be stated in the re-cord and included in the court’s minutes. (4) Use of Prior Convictions. Any prior felony conviction of any person in any criminal proceeding, whether adult or juvenile, shall subsequently be used without limitation for purposes of impeachment or enhancement of sentence in any criminal proceeding. When a prior felony conviction is an element of any felony offense, it shall be proven to the trier of fact in open court. (5) Truth in Sentencing. Sentences that are individually imposed upon convicted criminal wrongdoers based upon the facts and circumstances surrounding their cases shall be carried out in compliance with the courts’ sentencing orders, and shall not be substantially diminished by early re-lease policies intended to alleviate overcrowding in custodial facilities. The legislative branch shall ensure suffcient funding to adequately house inmates for the full terms of their sentences, except for statutorily autho-rized credits which reduce those sentences. (6) Reform of the parole process. The current process for parole hear-ings is excessive, especially in cases in which the defendant has been con-victed of murder. The parole hearing process must be reformed for the beneft of crime victims. (g) As used in this article, the term “serious felony” is any crime defned in subdivision (c) of Section 1192.7 of the Penal Code, or any successor statute.

It is not the intent of this section to deny any member, retired member, survivor, or benef-ciary a reasonable retirement allowance. Thus, this section shall not be construed as a repudiation of a debt nor the impairment of a contract for a substantial and reasonable retirement allowance from the Legislators’ Re-tirement System. (d) The people and the Legislature hereby fnd and declare that the dra-matic increase in the retirement allowances of persons described in subdi-vision (a) which would otherwise result when the compensation for those offces increases on November 5, 1986, or January 5, 1987, are not bene-fts which could have reasonably been expected. The people and the Leg-islature further fnd and declare that the Legislature did not intend to pro-vide in its scheme of compensation for those offces such windfall benefts. [New section adopted November 4, 1986.] [California Citizens Compensation Commission] SEC. 8. (a) The California Citizens Compensation Commission is hereby created and shall consist of seven members appointed by the Gov-ernor. The commission shall establish the annual salary and the medical, dental, insurance, and other similar benefts of state offcers. (b) The commission shall consist of the following persons: (1) Three public members, one of whom has expertise in the area of compensation, such as an economist, market researcher, or personnel man-ager; one of whom is a member of a nonproft public interest organization; and one of whom is representative of the general population and may in-clude, among others, a retiree, homemaker, or person of median income. No person appointed pursuant to this paragraph may, during the 12 months prior to his or her appointment, have held public offce, either elective or appointive, have been a candidate for elective public offce, or have been a lobbyist, as defned by the Political Reform Act of 1974. (2) Two members who have experience in the business community, one of whom is an executive of a corporation incorporated in this State which ranks among the largest private sector employers in the State based on the number of employees employed by the corporation in this State and one of whom is an owner of a small business in this State. (3) Two members, each of whom is an offcer or member of a labor or-ganization. (c) The Governor shall strive insofar as practicable to provide a bal-anced representation of the geographic, gender, racial, and ethnic diversity of the State in appointing commission members. (d) The Governor shall appoint commission members and designate a chairperson for the commission not later than 30 days after the effective date of this section. The terms of two of the initial appointees shall expire on December 31, 1992, two on December 31, 1994, and three on Decem-ber 31, 1996, as determined by the Governor. Thereafter, the term of each member shall be six years. Within 15 days of any vacancy, the Governor shall appoint a person to serve the unexpired portion of the term. (e) No current or former offcer or employee of this State is eligible for appointment to the commission. (f) Public notice shall be given of all meetings of the commission, and the meetings shall be open to the public. (g) On or before December 3, 1990, the commission shall, by a single resolution adopted by a majority of the membership of the commission, establish the annual salary and the medical, dental, insurance, and other similar benefts of state offcers. The annual salary and benefts specifed in that resolution shall be effective on and after December 3, 1990. Thereafter, at or before the end of each fscal year, the commission shall, by a resolution adopted by a majority of the membership of the commis-sion, adjust the medical, dental, insurance, and other similar benefts of state offcers. The benefts specifed in the resolution shall be effective on and after the frst Monday of the next December. Thereafter, at or before the end of each fscal year, the commission shall adjust the annual salary of state offcers by a resolution adopted by a ma-jority of the membership of the commission. The annual salary specifed in the resolution shall be effective on and after the frst Monday of the next December, except that a resolution shall not be adopted or take effect in any year that increases the annual salary of any state offcer if, on or before the immediately preceding June 1, the Director of Finance certifes to the commission, based on estimates for the current fscal year, that there will be a negative balance on June 30 of the current fscal year in the Special Fund for Economic Uncertainties in an amount equal to, or greater than, 1 percent of estimated General Fund revenues. (h) In establishing or adjusting the annual salary and the medical, den-tal, insurance, and other similar benefts, the commission shall consider all of the following: (1) The amount of time directly or indirectly related to the performance of the duties, functions, and services of a state offcer. (2) The amount of the annual salary and the medical, dental, insurance, and other similar benefts for other elected and appointed offcers and of-fcials in this State with comparable responsibilities, the judiciary, and, to the extent practicable, the private sector, recognizing, however, that state offcers do not receive, and do not expect to receive, compensation at the same levels as individuals in the private sector with comparable experi-ence and responsibilities. (3) The responsibility and scope of authority of the entity in which the state offcer serves. (4) Whether the Director of Finance estimates that there will be a nega-tive balance in the Special Fund for Economic Uncertainties in an amount equal to or greater than 1 percent of estimated General Fund revenues in the current fscal year. (i) Until a resolution establishing or adjusting the annual salary and the medical, dental, insurance, and other similar benefts for state offcers takes effect, each state offcer shall continue to receive the same annual salary and the medical, dental, insurance, and other similar benefts re-ceived previously. (j) All commission members shall receive their actual and necessary ex-penses, including travel expenses, incurred in the performance of their du-ties. Each member shall be compensated at the same rate as members, other than the chairperson, of the Fair Political Practices Commission, or its successor, for each day engaged in offcial duties, not to exceed 45 days per year. (k) It is the intent of the Legislature that the creation of the commission should not generate new state costs for staff and services. The Department of Personnel Administration, the Board of Administration of the Public Employees’ Retirement System, or other appropriate agencies, or their successors, shall furnish, from existing resources, staff and services to the commission as needed for the performance of its duties. (l) “State offcer,” as used in this section, means the Governor, Lieuten-ant Governor, Attorney General, Controller, Insurance Commissioner, Secretary of State, Superintendent of Public Instruction, Treasurer, mem-ber of the State Board of Equalization, and Member of the Legislature. [As amended May 19, 2009.] [Sale of Surplus State Property] SEC. 9. The proceeds from the sale of surplus state property occurring on or after the effective date of this section, and any proceeds from the previous sale of surplus state property that have not been expended or en-cumbered as of that date, shall be used to pay the principal and interest on bonds issued pursuant to the Economic Recovery Bond Act authorized at the March 2, 2004, statewide primary election. Once the principal and in-terest on those bonds are fully paid, the proceeds from the sale of surplus state property shall be deposited into the Special Fund for Economic Un-certainties, or any successor fund. For purposes of this section, surplus state property does not include property purchased with revenues de-scribed in Article XIX or any other special fund moneys.

See Section 1, below.] [Legislative Power] SECTION 1. The legislative power of this State is vested in the Califor-nia Legislature which consists of the Senate and Assembly, but the people reserve to themselves the powers of initiative and referendum. [New sec-tion adopted November 8, 1966.] SEC. 1a. [Renumbered Section 20 of Article XIII and amended Novem-ber 8, 1966.] SEC. 1b. [Repealed November 8, 1966.] SEC. 1c. [Repealed November 8, 1966.] SEC. 1d. [Repealed November 8, 1966.] [Legislators—Limitation on Incumbency—Restriction of Retirement Benefts—Limitation of Staff and Support Services—Number of Terms] SEC. 1.5. The people fnd and declare that the Founding Fathers estab-lished a system of representative government based upon free, fair, and competitive elections. The increased concentration of political power in the hands of incumbent representatives has made our electoral system less free, less competitive, and less representative. The ability of legislators to serve unlimited number of terms, to establish their own retirement system, and to pay for staff and support services at state expense contribute heavily to the extremely high number of incum-bents who are reelected. These unfair incumbent advantages discourage qualifed candidates from seeking public offce and create a class of career politicians, instead of the citizen representatives envisioned by the Found-ing Fathers. These career politicians become representatives of the bureau-cracy, rather than of the people whom they are elected to represent. To restore a free and democratic system of fair elections, and to encour-age qualifed candidates to seek public offce, the people fnd and declare that the powers of incumbency must be limited. Retirement benefts must be restricted, state-fnanced incumbent staff and support services limited, and limitations placed upon the number of terms which may be served. [New section adopted November 6, 1990. Initiative measure.] [Senate and Assembly—Membership—Elections—Number of Terms and Years of Service—Qualifcations—Vacancies] SEC. 2.

This subdivision shall apply only to those Members of the Senate or the Assem-bly who are frst elected to the Legislature after the effective date of this subdivision and who have not previously served in the Senate or Assem-bly. Members of the Senate or Assembly who were elected before the ef-fective date of this subdivision may serve only the number of terms al-lowed at the time of the last election before the effective date of this subdivision. (b) Election of members of the Assembly shall be on the frst Tuesday after the frst Monday in November of even-numbered years unless other-wise prescribed by the Legislature. Senators shall be elected at the same time and places as members of the Assembly. (c) A person is ineligible to be a member of the Legislature unless the person is an elector and has been a resident of the legislative district for one year, and a citizen of the United States and a resident of California for 3 years, immediately preceding the election, and service of the full term of offce to which the person is seeking to be elected would not exceed the maximum years of service permitted by subdivision (a) of this section. (d) When a vacancy occurs in the Legislature the Governor immediately shall call an election to fll the vacancy. [As amended June 5, 2012. Initiative measure.] [Legislative Sessions—Regular and Special Sessions] SEC. 3. (a) The Legislature shall convene in regular session at noon on the frst Monday in December of each even-numbered year and each house shall immediately organize. Each session of the Legislature shall adjourn sine die by operation of the Constitution at midnight on November 30 of the following even-numbered year. (b) On extraordinary occasions the Governor by proclamation may cause the Legislature to assemble in special session. When so assembled it has power to legislate only on subjects specifed in the proclamation but may provide for expenses and other matters incidental to the session.

(a) To eliminate any appearance of a confict with the proper discharge of his or her duties and responsibilities, no Member of the Leg-islature may knowingly receive any salary, wages, commissions, or other similar earned income from a lobbyist or lobbying frm, as defned by the Political Reform Act of 1974, or from a person who, during the previous 12 months, has been under a contract with the Legislature. The Legislature shall enact laws that defne earned income. However, earned income does not include any community property interest in the income of a spouse. Any Member who knowingly receives any salary, wages, commissions, or other similar earned income from a lobbyist employer, as defned by the Political Reform Act of 1974, may not, for a period of one year following its receipt, vote upon or make, participate in making, or in any way attempt to use his or her offcial position to infuence an action or decision before the Legislature, other than an action or decision involving a bill described in subdivision (c) of Section 12 of this article, which he or she knows, or has reason to know, would have a direct and signifcant fnancial impact on the lobbyist employer and would not impact the public generally or a sig-nifcant segment of the public in a similar manner.

The Legislature may, prior to their retirement, limit the retirement benefts payable to Members of the Legislature who serve during or after the term commenc-ing in 1967. When computing the retirement allowance of a Member who serves in the Legislature during the term commencing in 1967 or later, allowance may be made for increases in cost of living if so provided by statute, but only with respect to increases in the cost of living occurring after retire-ment of the Member. However, the Legislature may provide that no Mem-ber shall be deprived of a cost of living adjustment based on a monthly salary of fve hundred dollars ($500) which has accrued prior to the com-mencement of the 1967 Regular Session of the Legislature. [As amended June 5, 1990.] [Legislators—Retirement] SEC. 4.5. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Constitution or existing law, a person elected to or serving in the Legislature on or after November 1, 1990, shall participate in the Federal Social Security (Retire-ment, Disability, Health Insurance) Program and the State shall pay only the employer’s share of the contribution necessary to such participation. No other pension or retirement beneft shall accrue as a result of service in the Legislature, such service not being intended as a career occupation. This Section shall not be construed to abrogate or diminish any vested pension or retirement beneft which may have accrued under an existing law to a person holding or having held offce in the Legislature, but upon adoption of this Act no further entitlement to nor vesting in any existing program shall accrue to any such person, other than Social Security to the extent herein provided.

(a) (1) Each house of the Legislature shall judge the qualif-cations and elections of its Members and, by rollcall vote entered in the journal, two-thirds of the membership concurring, may expel a Member. (2) (A) Each house may suspend a Member by motion or resolution ad-opted by rollcall vote entered in the journal, two-thirds of the membership concurring. The motion or resolution shall contain fndings and declara-tions setting forth the basis for the suspension. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Constitution, the house may deem the salary and benefts of the Member to be forfeited for all or part of the period of the suspension by express provision of the motion or resolution. (B) A Member suspended pursuant to this paragraph shall not exercise any of the rights, privileges, duties, or powers of his or her offce, or utilize any resources of the Legislature, during the period the suspension is in ef-fect. (C) The suspension of a Member pursuant to this paragraph shall re-main in effect until the date specifed in the motion or resolution or, if no date is specifed, the date a subsequent motion or resolution terminating the suspension is adopted by rollcall vote entered in the journal, two-thirds of the membership of the house concurring. [Legislators—Honoraria] (b) No Member of the Legislature may accept any honorarium. The Legislature shall enact laws that implement this subdivision. [Legislators—Gifts—Confict of Interest] (c) The Legislature shall enact laws that ban or strictly limit the accep-tance of a gift by a Member of the Legislature from any source if the ac-ceptance of the gift might create a confict of interest. [Legislators—Prohibited Compensation or Activity] (d) No Member of the Legislature may knowingly accept any compensation for appearing, agreeing to appear, or taking any other action on behalf of another person before any state government board or agency. If a Member knowingly accepts any compensation for appearing, agreeing to appear, or taking any other action on behalf of another person before any local government board or agency, the Member may not, for a period of one year following the acceptance of the compensation, vote upon or make, participate in making, or in any way attempt to use his or her offcial position to infuence an action or decision before the Legislature, other than an action or decision involving a bill described in subdivision (c) of Section 12, which he or she knows, or has reason to know, would have a direct and signifcant fnancial impact on that person and would not impact the public generally or a signifcant segment of the public in a similar manner. As used in this subdivision, “public generally” includes an industry, trade, or profession. However, a Member may engage in activities involving a board or agency which are strictly on his or her own behalf, appear in the capacity of an attorney before any court or the Workers’ Compensation Appeals Board, or act as an advocate without compensation or make an inquiry for information on behalf of a person before a board or agency. This subdivision does not prohibit any action of a partnership or frm of which the Member is a member if the Member does not share directly or indirectly in the fee, less any expenses attributable to that fee, resulting from that action. [Legislators—Lobbying] (e) The Legislature shall enact laws that prohibit a Member of the Legislature whose term of offce commences on or after December 3, 1990, from lobbying, for compensation, as governed by the Political Reform Act of 1974, before the Legislature for 12 months after leaving offce. [Legislators—Confict of Interest] (f) The Legislature shall enact new laws, and strengthen the enforcement of existing laws, prohibiting Members of the Legislature from engaging in activities or having interests which confict with the proper discharge of their duties and responsibilities. However, the people reserve to themselves the power to implement this requirement pursuant to Article II. [As amended June 7, 2016.] SEC. 6. [Repealed June 3, 1980.

For the purpose of choosing members of the Legislature, the State shall be divided into 40 Senatorial and 80 Assembly districts to be called Senatorial and Assembly Districts. Each Senatorial district shall choose one Senator and each Assembly district shall choose one member of the Assembly. [New section adopted June 3, 1980.] [House Rules—Offcers—Quorum] SEC. 7.

The right to attend open and public proceedings includes the right of any person to re-cord by audio or video means any and all parts of the proceedings and to broadcast or otherwise transmit them; provided that the Legislature may adopt reasonable rules pursuant to paragraph (5) regulating the placement and use of the equipment for recording or broadcasting the proceedings for the sole purpose of minimizing disruption of the proceedings. Any ag-grieved party shall have standing to challenge said rules in an action for declaratory and injunctive relief, and the Legislature shall have the burden of demonstrating that the rule is reasonable. (2) Commencing on January 1 of the second calendar year following the adoption of this paragraph, the Legislature shall also cause audiovisual re-cordings to be made of all proceedings subject to paragraph (1) in their entirety, shall make such recordings public through the Internet within 24 hours after the proceedings have been recessed or adjourned for the day, and shall maintain an archive of said recordings, which shall be accessible to the public through the Internet and downloadable for a period of no less than 20 years as specifed by statute. (3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), closed sessions may be held solely for any of the following purposes: (A) To consider the appointment, employment, evaluation of perfor-mance, or dismissal of a public offcer or employee, to consider or hear complaints or charges brought against a Member of the Legislature or other public offcer or employee, or to establish the classifcation or com-pensation of an employee of the Legislature. (B) To consider matters affecting the safety and security of Members of the Legislature or its employees or the safety and security of any buildings and grounds used by the Legislature. (C) To confer with, or receive advice from, its legal counsel regarding pending or reasonably anticipated, or whether to initiate, litigation when discussion in open session would not protect the interests of the house or committee regarding the litigation. (4) A caucus of the Members of the Senate, the Members of the Assembly, or the Members of both houses, which is composed of the members of the same political party, may meet in closed session. (5) The Legislature shall implement this subdivision by concurrent res-olution adopted by rollcall vote entered in the journal, two-thirds of the membership of each house concurring, or by statute, and in the case of a closed session held pursuant to paragraph (3), shall prescribe that reason-able notice of the closed session and the purpose of the closed session shall be provided to the public.

(a) Lands owned by a local government that are outside its boundaries, including rights to use or divert water from surface or under-ground sources and any other interests in lands, are taxable if (1) they are located in Inyo or Mono County and (a) they were assessed for taxation to the local government in Inyo County as of the 1966 lien date, or in Mono County as of the 1967 lien date, whether or not the assessment was valid when made, or (b) they were acquired by the local government subsequent to that lien date and were assessed to a prior owner as of that lien date and each lien date thereafter, or (2) they are located outside Inyo or Mono County and were taxable when acquired by the local government. Im-provements owned by a local government that are outside its boundaries are taxable if they were taxable when acquired or were constructed by the local government to replace improvements which were taxable when ac-quired. (b) Taxable land belonging to a local government and located in Inyo County shall be assessed in any year subsequent to 1968 at the place where it was assessed as of the 1966 lien date and in an amount derived by mul-tiplying its 1966 assessed value by the ratio of the statewide per capita as-sessed value of land as of the last lien date prior to the current lien date to $766, using civilian population only. Taxable land belonging to a local government and located in Mono County shall be assessed in any year subsequent to 1968 at the place where it was assessed as of the 1967 lien date and in an amount determined by the preceding formula except that the 1967 lien date, the 1967 assessed value, and the fgure $856 shall be used in the formula. Taxable land belonging to a local government and located outside of Inyo and Mono counties shall be assessed at the place where located and in an amount that does not exceed the lower of (1) its fair mar-ket value times the prevailing percentage of fair market value at which other lands are assessed and (2) a fgure derived in the manner specifed in this Section for land located in Mono County. If land acquired by a local government after the lien date of the base year specifed in this Section was assessed in the base year as part of a larger parcel, the assessed value of the part in the base year shall be that fraction of the assessed value of the larger parcel that the area of the part is of the area of the larger parcel. If a local government divests itself of ownership of land without water rights and this land was assessed in Inyo County as of the 1966 lien date or in Mono County as of the 1967 lien date, the divestment shall not dimin-ish the quantity of water rights assessable and taxable at the place where assessed as of that lien date. (c) In the event the Legislature changes the prevailing percentage of fair market value at which land is assessed for taxation, there shall be used in the computations required by Section 11(b) of this Article, for the frst year for which the new percentage is applicable, in lieu of the statewide per capita assessed value of land as of the last lien date prior to the current lien date, the statewide per capita assessed value of land on the prior lien date times the ratio of the new prevailing percentage of fair market value to the previous prevailing percentage. (d) If, after March 1954, a taxable improvement is replaced while owned by and in possession of a local government, the replacement improvement shall be assessed, as long as it is owned by a local government, as other improvements are except that the assessed value shall not exceed the prod-uct of (1) the percentage at which privately owned improvements are as-sessed times (2) the highest full value ever used for taxation of the im-provement that has been replaced. For purposes of this calculation, the full value for any year prior to 1967 shall be conclusively presumed to be 4 times the assessed value in that year. (e) No tax, charge, assessment, or levy of any character, other than those taxes authorized by Sections 11(a) to 11(d), inclusive, of this Article, shall be imposed upon one local government by another local government that is based or calculated upon the consumption or use of water outside the boundaries of the government imposing it. (f) Any taxable interest of any character, other than a lease for agricul-tural purposes and an interest of a local government, in any land owned by a local government that is subject to taxation pursuant to Section 11(a) of this Article shall be taxed in the same manner as other taxable interests. The aggregate value of all the interests subject to taxation pursuant to Sec-tion 11(a), however, shall not exceed the value of all interests in the land less the taxable value of the interest of any local government ascertained as provided in Sections 11(a) to 11(e), inclusive, of this Article. (g) Any assessment made pursuant to Sections 11(a) to 11(d), inclusive, of this Article shall be subject to review, equalization, and adjustment by the State Board of Equalization, but an adjustment shall conform to the provisions of these Sections.

(a) Except as provided in subdivision (b), taxes on personal property, possessory interests in land, and taxable improvements located on land exempt from taxation which are not a lien upon land suffcient in value to secure their payment shall be levied at the rates for the preceding tax year upon property of the same kind where the taxes were a lien upon land suffcient in value to secure their payment. (b) In any year in which the assessment ratio is changed, the Legislature shall adjust the rate described in subdivision (a) to maintain equality be-tween property on the secured and unsecured rolls.

State funds re-quired by this paragraph shall be from a source other than those described in subdivisions (b) and (d), ad valorem property taxes, or the Social Ser-vices Subaccount of the Sales Tax Account of the Local Revenue Fund. (5) (A) For programs described in subparagraphs (C) to (E), inclusive, of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) and included in the 2011 Realignment Legislation, if there are subsequent changes in federal statutes or regula-tions that alter the conditions under which federal matching funds as de-scribed in the 2011 Realignment Legislation are obtained, and have the overall effect of increasing the costs incurred by a local agency, the State shall annually provide at least 50 percent of the nonfederal share of those costs as determined by the State. (B) When the State is a party to any complaint brought in a federal ju-dicial or administrative proceeding that involves one or more of the pro-grams described in subparagraphs (C) to (E), inclusive, of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) and included in the 2011 Realignment Legislation, and there is a settlement or judicial or administrative order that imposes a cost in the form of a monetary penalty or has the overall effect of increasing the costs already borne by a local agency for programs or levels of service mandated by the 2011 Realignment Legislation, the State shall annually provide at least 50 percent of the nonfederal share of those costs as deter-mined by the State. Payment by the State is not required if the State deter-mines that the settlement or order relates to one or more local agencies failing to perform a ministerial duty, failing to perform a legal obligation in good faith, or acting in a negligent or reckless manner. (C) The state funds provided in this paragraph shall be from funding sources other than those described in subdivisions (b) and (d), ad valorem property taxes, or the Social Services Subaccount of the Sales Tax Account of the Local Revenue Fund. (6) If the State or a local agency fails to perform a duty or obligation under this section or under the 2011 Realignment Legislation, an appropri-ate party may seek judicial relief. These proceedings shall have priority over all other civil matters. (7) The funds deposited into a County Local Revenue Fund 2011 shall be spent in a manner designed to maintain the State’s eligibility for federal matching funds, and to ensure compliance by the State with appli-cable federal standards governing the State’s provision of Public Safety Services. (8) The funds deposited into a County Local Revenue Fund 2011 shall not be used by local agencies to supplant other funding for Public Safety Services. (d) If the taxes described in subdivision (b) are reduced or cease to be operative, the State shall annually provide moneys to the Local Revenue Fund 2011 in an amount equal to or greater than the aggregate amount that otherwise would have been provided by the taxes described in subdivision (b). The method for determining that amount shall be described in the 2011 Realignment Legislation, and the State shall be obligated to provide that amount for so long as the local agencies are required to perform the Public Safety Services responsibilities assigned by the 2011 Realignment Legislation. If the State fails to annually appropriate that amount, the Con-troller shall transfer that amount from the General Fund in pro rata month-ly shares to the Local Revenue Fund 2011. Thereafter, the Controller shall disburse these amounts to local agencies in the manner directed by the 2011 Realignment Legislation. The state obligations under this subdivi-sion shall have a lower priority claim to General Fund money than the frst priority for money to be set apart under Section 8 of Article XVI and the second priority to pay voter-approved debts and liabilities described in Section 1 of Article XVI. (e) (1) To ensure that public education is not harmed in the process of providing critical protection to local Public Safety Services, the Education Protection Account is hereby created in the General Fund to receive and disburse the revenues derived from the incremental increases in taxes im-posed by this section, as specifed in subdivision (f). (2) (A) Before June 30, 2013, and before June 30 of each year from 2014 to 2030, inclusive, the Director of Finance shall estimate the total amount of additional revenues, less refunds, that will be derived from the incremental increases in tax rates made in subdivision (f) that will be avail-able for transfer into the Education Protection Account during the next fs-cal year. The Director of Finance shall make the same estimate by January 10, 2013, for additional revenues, less refunds, that will be received by the end of the 2012–13 fscal year. (B) During the last 10 days of the quarter of each of the frst three quar-ters of each fscal year from 2013–14 to 2030–31, inclusive, the Controller shall transfer into the Education Protection Account one-fourth of the total amount estimated pursuant to subparagraph (A) for that fscal year, except as this amount may be adjusted pursuant to subparagraph (D). (C) In each of the fscal years from 2012–13 to 2032–33, inclusive, the Director of Finance shall calculate an adjustment to the Education Protec-tion Account, as specifed by subparagraph (D), by adding together the following amounts, as applicable: (i) In the last quarter of each fscal year from 2012–13 to 2030–31, in-clusive, the Director of Finance shall recalculate the estimate made for the fscal year pursuant to subparagraph (A), and shall subtract from this up-dated estimate the amounts previously transferred to the Education Protec-tion Account for that fscal year. (ii) In June 2015 and in every June from 2016 to 2033, inclusive, the Director of Finance shall make a fnal determination of the amount of ad-ditional revenues, less refunds, derived from the incremental increases in tax rates made in subdivision (f) for the fscal year ending two years prior. The amount of the updated estimate calculated in clause (i) for the fscal year ending two years prior shall be subtracted from the amount of this f-nal determination. (D) If the sum determined pursuant to subparagraph (C) is positive, the Controller shall transfer an amount equal to that sum into the Education Protection Account within 10 days preceding the end of the fscal year. If that amount is negative, the Controller shall suspend or reduce subsequent quarterly transfers, if any, to the Education Protection Account until the total reduction equals the negative amount herein described. For purposes of any calculation made pursuant to clause (i) of subparagraph (C), the amount of a quarterly transfer shall not be modifed to refect any suspen-sion or reduction made pursuant to this subparagraph. (E) Before June 30, 2018, and before June 30 of each year from 2019 to 2030, inclusive, the Director of Finance shall estimate the amount of the additional revenues, less refunds, to be derived in the following fscal year from the incremental increases in tax rates made in subdivision (f), that, when combined with all other available General Fund revenues, will be required to meet: (i) The minimum funding guarantee of Section 8 of Article XVI for that following fscal year; and (ii) The workload budget for that following fscal year, excluding any program expenditures already accounted for through clause (i). For pur-poses of this section, “workload budget” has the meaning set forth in Sec-tion 13308.05 of the Government Code, as that section read and was inter-preted by the Department of Finance on January 1, 2016, provided, however, that “currently authorized services” shall mean only those ser-vices that would have been considered “currently authorized services” un-der Section 13308.05 of the Government Code as of January 1, 2016. (F) In order to enhance the ability of all California school children and their families to receive regular, quality health care and thereby minimize school absenteeism due to health-related problems, whenever the Director of Finance estimates that the amount available for transfer into the Educa-tion Protection Account during the following fscal year exceeds the amount of revenues required from that account pursuant to subparagraph (E) for that following fscal year, the director shall identify the remaining amount. Fifty percent of that remainder, up to a maximum of two billion dollars in any single fscal year, shall be allocated by the Controller from the Education Protection Account to the California Department of Health Care Services on a quarterly basis to increase funding for the existing health care programs and services described in Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 14000) to Chapter 8.9 (commencing with Section 14700), inclusive, of Part 3 of Division 9 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. The funding shall be used only for critical, emergency, acute, and preventive health care services to children and their families, provided by health care professionals and health facilities that are licensed pursuant to Section 1250 of the Health and Safety Code, and to health plans or others that manage the provision of health care for Medi-Cal benefciaries that are contracting with the California Department of Health Care Services to provide health benefts pursuant to this section. (G) The allocation provided for in subparagraph (F) may be suspended by statute during a fscal year in which a budget emergency has been de-clared, provided, however, that the allocation shall not be reduced beyond the proportional reduction in overall General Fund expenditures for that year. For purposes of this section, “budget emergency” has the same mean-ing as in paragraph (2) of subdivision (b) of Section 22 of Article XVI. (H) The funding provided pursuant to subparagraph (F) shall not be used to supplant existing state General Funds for the nonfederal share of payments for those programs and, consistent with federal law, shall be used to obtain federal matching Medicaid funds. (3) All moneys in the Education Protection Account are hereby continu-ously appropriated for the support of school districts, county offces of education, charter schools, and community college districts as set forth in this paragraph, and for health care as set forth in subparagraph (F) of para-graph (2). (A) Eleven percent of the moneys appropriated for education pursuant to this paragraph shall be allocated quarterly by the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges to community college districts to pro-vide general purpose funding to community college districts in proportion to the amounts determined pursuant to Section 84750.5 of the Education Code, as that code section read on November 6, 2012. The allocations cal-culated pursuant to this subparagraph shall be offset by the amounts spec-ifed in subdivisions (a), (c), and (d) of Section 84751 of the Education Code, as that section read on November 6, 2012, that are in excess of the amounts calculated pursuant to Section 84750.5 of the Education Code, as that section read on November 6, 2012, provided that no community col-lege district shall receive less than one hundred dollars ($100) per full time equivalent student. (B) Eighty-nine percent of the moneys appropriated for education pur-suant to this paragraph shall be allocated quarterly by the Superintendent of Public Instruction to provide general purpose funding to school dis-tricts, county offces of education, and state general-purpose funding to charter schools in proportion to the revenue limits calculated pursuant to Sections 2558 and 42238 of the Education Code and the amounts calcu-lated pursuant to Section 47633 of the Education Code for county offces of education, school districts, and charter schools, respectively, as those sections read on November 6, 2012. The amounts so calculated shall be offset by the amounts specifed in subdivision (c) of Section 2558 of, para-graphs (1) through (7) of subdivision (h) of Section 42238 of, and Section 47635 of, the Education Code for county offces of education, school dis-tricts, and charter schools, respectively, as those sections read on Novem-ber 6, 2012, that are in excess of the amounts calculated pursuant to Sec-tions 2558, 42238, and 47633 of the Education Code for county offces of education, school districts, and charter schools, respectively, as those sec-tions read on November 6, 2012, provided that no school district, county offce of education, or charter school shall receive less than two hundred dollars ($200) per unit of average daily attendance. (4) This subdivision is self-executing and requires no legislative action to take effect. Distribution of the moneys in the Education Protection Ac-count by the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges and the Superintendent of Public Instruction shall not be delayed or other-wise affected by failure of the Legislature and Governor to enact an an-nual budget bill pursuant to Section 12 of Article IV, by invocation of sub-division (h) of Section 8 of Article XVI, or by any other action or failure to act by the Legislature or Governor. (5) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the moneys deposited in the Education Protection Account for education shall not be used to pay any costs incurred by the Legislature, the Governor, or any agency of state government. (6) A community college district, county offce of education, school dis-trict, or charter school shall have sole authority to determine how the mon-eys received from the Education Protection Account are spent in the school or schools within its jurisdiction, provided, however, that the appropriate governing board or body shall make these spending determinations in open session of a public meeting of the governing board or body and shall not use any of the funds from the Education Protection Account for sala-ries or benefts of administrators or any other administrative costs. Each community college district, county offce of education, school district, and charter school shall annually publish on its Internet Web site an accounting of how much money was received from the Education Protection Account and how that money was spent. (7) The annual independent fnancial and compliance audit required of community college districts, county offces of education, school districts, and charter schools shall, in addition to all other requirements of law, as-certain and verify whether the funds provided from the Education Protec-tion Account have been properly disbursed and expended as required by this section. Expenses incurred by those entities to comply with the addi-tional audit requirement of this section may be paid with funding from the Education Protection Account, and shall not be considered administrative costs for purposes of this section. (8) Revenues, less refunds, derived pursuant to subdivision (f) for de-posit in the Education Protection Account pursuant to this section shall be deemed “General Fund revenues,” “General Fund proceeds of taxes,” and “moneys to be applied by the State for the support of school districts and community college districts” for purposes of Section 8 of Article XVI. (f) (1) (A) In addition to the taxes imposed by Part 1 (commencing with Section 6001) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, for the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail, a tax is hereby imposed upon all retailers at the rate of ¼ percent of the gross receipts of any retailer from the sale of all tangible personal property sold at retail in this State on and after January 1, 2013, and before January 1, 2017. (B) In addition to the taxes imposed by Part 1 (commencing with Sec-tion 6001) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, an excise tax is hereby imposed on the storage, use, or other consumption in this State of tangible personal property purchased from any retailer on and after Jan-uary 1, 2013, and before January 1, 2017, for storage, use, or other con-sumption in this state at the rate of ¼ percent of the sales price of the property. (C) The Sales and Use Tax Law, including any amendments enacted on or after the effective date of this section, shall apply to the taxes imposed pursuant to this paragraph. (D) This paragraph shall become inoperative on January 1, 2017. (2) For any taxable

rate of 9.3 percent set forth in paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 17041 of the Revenue and Taxation Code shall be modifed by each of the following: (A) (i) For that portion of taxable income that is over two hundred ffty thousand dollars ($250,000) but not over three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000), the tax rate is 10.3 percent of the excess over two hundred ffty thousand

Revenue and Taxation Code, this paragraph shall be considered to be chaptered on November 6, 2012. (ii) For purposes of Part 10 (commencing with Section 17001) of, and Part 10.2 (commencing with Section 18401) of, Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, the modifed tax brackets and tax rates established and imposed by this paragraph shall be deemed to be established and imposed under Section 17041 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. (D) This paragraph shall become inoperative on December 1, 2031. (3) For any taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2012, and be-fore January 1, 2031, with respect to the tax imposed pursuant to Section 17041 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, the income tax bracket and the rate of 9.3 percent set forth in paragraph (1) of

Initiative measure.] [Valuation of Real Property—Appraised Value After 1975 Assessment—Replacement Dwelling] SEC. 2. (a) The “full cash value” means the county assessor’s valua-tion of real property as shown on the 1975–76 tax bill under “full cash value” or, thereafter, the appraised value of real property when purchased, newly constructed, or a change in ownership has occurred after the 1975 assessment. All real property not already assessed up to the 1975–76 full cash value may be reassessed to refect that valuation. For purposes of this section, “newly constructed” does not include real property that is recon-structed after a disaster, as declared by the Governor, where the fair market value of the real property, as reconstructed, is comparable to its fair market value prior to the disaster. For purposes of this section, the term “newly constructed” does not include that portion of an existing structure that con-sists of the construction or reconstruction of seismic retroftting compo-nents, as defned by the Legislature. However, the Legislature may provide that, under appropriate circum-stances and pursuant to defnitions and procedures established by the Leg-islature, any person over the age of 55 years who resides in property that is eligible for the homeowner’s exemption under subdivision (k) of Sec-tion 3 of Article XIII and any implementing legislation may transfer the base year value of the property entitled to exemption, with the adjustments authorized by subdivision (b), to any replacement dwelling of equal or lesser value located within the same county and purchased or newly con-structed by that person as his or her principal residence within two years of the sale of the original property. For purposes of this section, “any per-son over the age of 55 years” includes a married couple one member of which is over the age of 55 years. For purposes of this section, “replace-ment dwelling” means a building, structure, or other shelter constituting a place of abode, whether real property or personal property, and any land on which it may be situated. For purposes of this section, a two-dwelling unit shall be considered as two separate single-family dwellings. This paragraph shall apply to any replacement dwelling that was purchased or newly constructed on or after November 5, 1986. In addition, the Legislature may authorize each county board of supervi-sors, after consultation with the local affected agencies within the county’s boundaries, to adopt an ordinance making the provisions of this subdivi-sion relating to transfer of base year value also applicable to situations in which the replacement dwellings are located in that county and the origi-nal properties are located in another county within this State. For purposes of this paragraph, “local affected agency” means any city, special district, school district, or community college district that receives an annual prop-erty tax revenue allocation. This paragraph applies to any replacement dwelling that was purchased or newly constructed on or after the date the county adopted the provisions of this subdivision relating to transfer of base year value, but does not apply to any replacement dwelling that was purchased or newly constructed before November 9, 1988. The Legislature may extend the provisions of this subdivision relating to the transfer of base year values from original properties to replacement dwellings of homeowners over the age of 55 years to severely disabled homeowners, but only with respect to those replacement dwellings pur-chased or newly constructed on or after the effective date of this para-graph. [Full Cash Value Refecting Infationary Rate] (b) The full cash value base may refect from year to year the infation-ary rate not to exceed 2 percent for any given year or reduction as shown in the consumer price index or comparable data for the area under taxing jurisdiction, or may be reduced to refect substantial damage, destruction, or other factors causing a decline in value. [“Newly Constructed”] (c) For purposes of subdivision (a), the Legislature may provide that the term “newly constructed” does not include any of the following: (1) The construction or addition of any active solar energy system. (2) The construction or installation of any fre sprinkler system, other fre extinguishing system, fre detection system, or fre-related egress im-provement, as defned by the Legislature, that is constructed or installed after the effective date of this paragraph. (3) The construction, installation, or modifcation on or after the effec-tive date of this paragraph of any portion or structural component of a single- or multiple-family dwelling that is eligible for the homeowner’s exemption if the construction, installation, or modifcation is for the pur-pose of making the dwelling more accessible to a severely disabled per-son. (4) The construction, installation, removal, or modifcation on or after the effective date of this paragraph of any portion or structural component of an existing building or structure if the construction, installation, remov-al, or modifcation is for the purpose of making the building more acces-sible to, or more usable by, a disabled person. (5) The construction or addition, completed on or after January 1, 2019, of a rain water capture system, as defned by the Legislature. [“Change in Ownership”] (d) For purposes of this section, the term “change in ownership” does not include the acquisition of real property as a replacement for compa-rable property if the person acquiring the real property has been displaced from the property replaced by eminent domain proceedings, by acquisition by a public entity, or governmental action that has resulted in a judgment of inverse condemnation. The real property acquired shall be deemed com-parable to the property replaced if it is similar in size, utility, and function, or if it conforms to state regulations defned by the Legislature governing the relocation of persons displaced by governmental actions. This subdivi-sion applies to any property acquired after March 1, 1975, but affects only those assessments of that property that occur after the provisions of this subdivision take effect. [Disasters—Replacement Property] (e) (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Legis-lature shall provide that the base year value of property that is substan-tially damaged or destroyed by a disaster, as declared by the Governor, may be transferred to comparable property within the same county that is acquired or newly constructed as a replacement for the substantially dam-aged or destroyed property. (2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), this subdivision applies to any comparable replacement property acquired or newly constructed on or af-ter July 1, 1985, and to the determination of base year values for the 1985– 86 fscal year and fscal years thereafter. (3) In addition to the transfer of base year value of property within the same county that is permitted by paragraph (1), the Legislature may autho-rize each county board of supervisors to adopt, after consultation with af-fected local agencies within the county, an ordinance allowing the transfer of the base year value of property that is located within another county in the State and is substantially damaged or destroyed by a disaster, as de-clared by the Governor, to comparable replacement property of equal or lesser value that is located within the adopting county and is acquired or newly constructed within three years of the substantial damage or destruc-tion of the original property as a replacement for that property.

The base year value of the qual-ifed contaminated property may be transferred to a replacement real prop-erty located within another county if the board of supervisors of that other county has, after consultation with the affected local agencies within that county, adopted a resolution authorizing an intercounty transfer of base year value as so described. (ii) This subparagraph applies only to replacement property that is ac-quired or newly constructed within fve years after ownership in the qual-ifed contaminated property is sold or otherwise transferred. (B) In the case in which the remediation of the environmental problems on the qualifed contaminated property requires the destruction of, or re-sults in substantial damage to, a structure located on that property, the term “new construction” does not include the repair of a substantially damaged structure, or the construction of a structure replacing a destroyed structure on the qualifed contaminated property, performed after the remediation of the environmental problems on that property, provided that the repaired or replacement structure is similar in size, utility, and function to the original structure. (2) For purposes of this subdivision, “qualifed contaminated property” means residential or nonresidential real property that is all of the follow-ing: (A) In the case of residential real property, rendered uninhabitable, and in the case of nonresidential real property, rendered unusable, as the result of either environmental problems, in the nature of and including, but not limited to, the presence of toxic or hazardous materials, or the remediation of those environmental problems, except where the existence of the envi-ronmental problems was known to the owner, or to a related individual or entity as described in paragraph (3), at the time the real property was ac-quired or constructed. For purposes of this subparagraph, residential real property is “uninhabitable” if that property, as a result of health hazards caused by or associated with the environmental problems, is unft for hu-man habitation, and nonresidential real property is “unusable” if that prop-erty, as a result of health hazards caused by or associated with the environ-mental problems, is unhealthy and unsuitable for occupancy. (B) Located on a site that has been designated as a toxic or environmen-tal hazard or as an environmental cleanup site by an agency of the State of California or the federal government. (C) Real property that contains a structure or structures thereon prior to the completion of environmental cleanup activities, and that structure or structures are substantially damaged or destroyed as a result of those envi-ronmental cleanup activities. (D) Stipulated by the lead governmental agency, with respect to the en-vironmental problems or environmental cleanup of the real property, not to have been rendered uninhabitable or unusable, as applicable, as de-scribed in subparagraph (A), by any act or omission in which an owner of that real property participated or acquiesced. (3) It shall be rebuttably presumed that an owner of the real property participated or acquiesced in any act or omission that rendered the real property uninhabitable or unusable, as applicable, if that owner is related to any individual or entity that committed that act or omission in any of the following ways: (A) Is a spouse, parent, child, grandparent, grandchild, or sibling of that individual. (B) Is a corporate parent, subsidiary, or affliate of that entity. (C) Is an owner of, or has control of, that entity. (D) Is owned or controlled by that entity. If this presumption is not overcome, the owner shall not receive the relief provided for in subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1).

Initiative measure. which does not exceed the reasonable costs to the local government of pro-viding the service or product. (3) A charge imposed for the reasonable regulatory costs to a local gov-ernment for issuing licenses and permits, performing investigations, in-spections, and audits, enforcing agricultural marketing orders, and the ad-ministrative enforcement and adjudication thereof. (4) A charge imposed for entrance to or use of local government prop-erty, or the purchase, rental, or lease of local government property. (5) A fne, penalty, or other monetary charge imposed by the judicial branch of government or a local government, as a result of a violation of law. (6) A charge imposed as a condition of property development. (7) Assessments and property-related fees imposed in accordance with the provisions of Article XIII D. The local government bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a levy, charge, or other exaction is not a tax, that the amount is no more than necessary to cover the reasonable costs of the gov-ernmental activity, and that the manner in which those costs are allocated to a payor bear a fair or reasonable relationship to the payor’s burdens on, or benefts received from, the governmental activity. [As amended Novem-ber 2, 2010. Initiative measure.] SEC. 2. Local Government Tax Limitation. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Constitution: (a) All taxes imposed by any local government shall be deemed to be either general taxes or special taxes. Special purpose districts or agencies, including school districts, shall have no power to levy general taxes. (b) No local government may impose, extend, or increase any general tax unless and until that tax is submitted to the electorate and approved by a majority vote. A general tax shall not be deemed to have been increased if it is imposed at a rate not higher than the maximum rate so approved. The election required by this subdivision shall be consolidated with a reg-ularly scheduled general election for members of the governing body of the local government, except in cases of emergency declared by a unani-mous vote of the governing body. (c) Any general tax imposed, extended, or increased, without voter ap-proval, by any local government on or after January 1, 1995, and prior to the effective date of this article, shall continue to be imposed only if ap-proved by a majority vote of the voters voting in an election on the issue of the imposition, which election shall be held within two years of the ef-fective date of this article and in compliance with subdivision (b). (d) No local government may impose, extend, or increase any special tax unless and until that tax is submitted to the electorate and approved by a two-thirds vote.

The power of initia-tive to affect local taxes, assessments, fees and charges shall be applicable to all local governments and neither the Legislature nor any local govern-ment charter shall impose a signature requirement higher than that appli-cable to statewide statutory initiatives. [New section adopted November 5, 1996. Initiative measure.] ARTICLE XIII D * ASSESSMENT AND PROPERTY-RELATED FEE REFORM SECTION 1. Application. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the provisions of this article shall apply to all assessments, fees and charg-es, whether imposed pursuant to state statute or local government charter authority.

Property Taxes, Assessments, Fees and Charges Limit-ed. (a) No tax, assessment, fee, or charge shall be assessed by any agen-cy upon any parcel of property or upon any person as an incident of prop-erty ownership except: (1) The ad valorem property tax imposed pursuant to Article XIII and Article XIII A. (2) Any special tax receiving a two-thirds vote pursuant to Section 4 of Article XIII A. (3) Assessments as provided by this article. (4) Fees or charges for property-related services as provided by this ar-ticle. (b) For purposes of this article, fees for the provision of electrical or gas service shall not be deemed charges or fees imposed as an incident of property ownership. [New section adopted November 5, 1996. Initiative measure.] SEC. 4. Procedures and Requirements for All Assessments. (a) An agency which proposes to levy an assessment shall identify all parcels which will have a special beneft conferred upon them and upon which an assessment will be imposed. The proportionate special beneft derived by each identifed parcel shall be determined in relationship to the entirety of the capital cost of a public improvement, the maintenance and operation expenses of a public improvement, or the cost of the property-related ser-vice being provided. No assessment shall be imposed on any parcel which exceeds the reasonable cost of the proportional special beneft conferred on that parcel. Only special benefts are assessable, and an agency shall separate the general benefts from the special benefts conferred on a par-cel. Parcels within a district that are owned or used by any agency, the State of California or the United States shall not be exempt from assess-ment unless the agency can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that those publicly owned parcels in fact receive no special beneft. (b) All assessments shall be supported by a detailed engineer’s report prepared by a registered professional engineer certifed by the State of California. (c) The amount of the proposed assessment for each identifed parcel shall be calculated and the record owner of each parcel shall be given writ-ten notice by mail of the proposed assessment, the total amount thereof chargeable to the entire district, the amount chargeable to the owner’s par-ticular parcel, the duration of the payments, the reason for the assessment and the basis upon which the amount of the proposed assessment was cal-culated, together with the date, time, and location of a public hearing on the proposed assessment. Each notice shall also include, in a conspicuous place thereon, a summary of the procedures applicable to the completion, return, and tabulation of the ballots required pursuant to subdivision (d), including a disclosure statement that the existence of a majority protest, as defned in subdivision (e), will result in the assessment not being imposed. (d) Each notice mailed to owners of identifed parcels within the district pursuant to subdivision (c) shall contain a ballot which includes the agen-cy’s address for receipt of the ballot once completed by any owner receiv-ing the notice whereby the owner may indicate his or her name, reasonable identifcation of the parcel, and his or her support or opposition to the pro-posed assessment. (e) The agency shall conduct a public hearing upon the proposed assess-ment not less than 45 days after mailing the notice of the proposed assess-ment to record owners of each identifed parcel. At the public hearing, the agency shall consider all protests against the proposed assessment and tabulate the ballots. The agency shall not impose an assessment if there is a majority protest. A majority protest exists if, upon the conclusion of the hearing, ballots submitted in opposition to the assessment exceed the bal-lots submitted in favor of the assessment. In tabulating the ballots, the bal-lots shall be weighted according to the proportional fnancial obligation of the affected property. (f) In any legal action contesting the validity of any assessment, the bur-den shall be on the agency to demonstrate that the property or properties in question receive a special beneft over and above the benefts conferred on the public at large and that the amount of any contested assessment is proportional to, and no greater than, the benefts conferred on the property or properties in question. (g) Because only special benefts are assessable, electors residing with-in the district who do not own property within the district shall not be deemed under this Constitution to have been deprived of the right to vote for any assessment. If a court determines that the Constitution of the Unit-ed States or other federal law requires otherwise, the assessment shall not be imposed unless approved by a two-thirds vote of the electorate in the district in addition to being approved by the property owners as required by subdivision (e). [New section adopted November 5, 1996. Initiative measure.] SEC. 5. Effective Date. Pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 10 of Article II, the provisions of this article shall become effective the day after the election unless otherwise provided. Beginning July 1, 1997, all exist-ing, new, or increased assessments shall comply with this article. Notwith-standing the foregoing, the following assessments existing on the effective date of this article shall be exempt from the procedures and approval pro-cess set forth in Section 4: (a) Any assessment imposed exclusively to fnance the capital costs or maintenance and operation expenses for sidewalks, streets, sewers, water, food control, drainage systems or vector control. Subsequent increases in such assessments shall be subject to the procedures and approval process set forth in Section 4. (b) Any assessment imposed pursuant to a petition signed by the per-sons owning all of the parcels subject to the assessment at the time the as-sessment is initially imposed. Subsequent increases in such assessments shall be subject to the procedures and approval process set forth in Section 4. (c) Any assessment the proceeds of which are exclusively used to repay bonded indebtedness of which the failure to pay would violate the Con-tract Impairment Clause of the Constitution of the United States. (d) Any assessment which previously received majority voter approval from the voters voting in an election on the issue of the assessment. Sub-sequent increases in those assessments shall be subject to the procedures and approval process set forth in Section 4. [New section adopted Novem-ber 5, 1996. Initiative measure.] SEC. 6. Property-Related Fees and Charges. (a) Procedures for New or Increased Fees and Charges. An agency shall follow the procedures pursuant to this section in imposing or increasing any fee or charge as de-fned pursuant to this article, including, but not limited to, the following: (1) The parcels upon which a fee or charge is proposed for imposition shall be identifed. The amount of the fee or charge proposed to be im-posed upon each parcel shall be calculated. The agency shall provide writ-ten notice by mail of the proposed fee or charge to the record owner of each identifed parcel upon which the fee or charge is proposed for impo-sition, the amount of the fee or charge proposed to be imposed upon each, the basis upon which the amount of the proposed fee or charge was calcu-lated, the reason for the fee or charge, together with the date, time, and location of a public hearing on the proposed fee or charge. (2) The agency shall conduct a public hearing upon the proposed fee or charge not less than 45 days after mailing the notice of the proposed fee or charge to the record owners of each identifed parcel upon which the fee or charge is proposed for imposition. At the public hearing, the agency shall consider all protests against the proposed fee or charge. If written protests against the proposed fee or charge are presented by a majority of owners of the identifed parcels, the agency shall not impose the fee or charge. (b) Requirements for Existing, New or Increased Fees and Charges. A fee or charge shall not be extended, imposed, or increased by any agency unless it meets all of the following requirements: (1) Revenues derived from the fee or charge shall not exceed the funds required to provide the property-related service. (2) Revenues derived from the fee or charge shall not be used for any purpose other than that for which the fee or charge was imposed. (3) The amount of a fee or charge imposed upon any parcel or person as an incident of property ownership shall not exceed the proportional cost of the service attributable to the parcel. (4) No fee or charge may be imposed for a service unless that service is actually used by, or immediately available to, the owner of the property in question. Fees or charges based on potential or future use of a service are not permitted. Standby charges, whether characterized as charges or as-sessments, shall be classifed as assessments and shall not be imposed without compliance with Section 4. (5) No fee or charge may be imposed for general governmental services including, but not limited to, police, fre, ambulance or library services, where the service is available to the public at large in substantially the same manner as it is to property owners. Reliance by an agency on any parcel map, including, but not limited to, an assessor’s parcel map, may be considered a signifcant factor in deter-mining whether a fee or charge is imposed as an incident of property own-ership for purposes of this article. In any legal action contesting the valid-ity of a fee or charge, the burden shall be on the agency to demonstrate compliance with this article. (c) Voter Approval for New or Increased Fees and Charges. Except for fees or charges for sewer, water, and refuse collection services, no proper-ty-related fee or charge shall be imposed or increased unless and until that fee or charge is submitted and approved by a majority vote of the property owners of the property subject to the fee or charge or, at the option of the agency, by a two-thirds vote of the electorate residing in the affected area. The election shall be conducted not less than 45 days after the public hear-ing. An agency may adopt procedures similar to those for increases in as-sessments in the conduct of elections under this subdivision. (d) Beginning July 1, 1997, all fees or charges shall comply with this section.

A complete system of workers’ compensation includes adequate provisions for the comfort, health and safety and general welfare of any and all work- * New Article XIV adopted June 8, 1976. ers and those dependent upon them for support to the extent of relieving from the consequences of any injury or death incurred or sustained by workers in the course of their employment, irrespective of the fault of any party; also full provision for securing safety in places of employment; full provision for such medical, surgical, hospital and other remedial treatment as is requisite to cure and relieve from the effects of such injury; full provision for adequate insurance coverage against liability to pay or furnish compensation; full provision for regulating such insurance coverage in all its aspects, including the establishment and management of a state compensation insurance fund; full provision for otherwise securing the payment of compensation; and full provision for vesting power, authority and jurisdiction in an administrative body with all the requisite governmental functions to determine any dispute or matter arising under such legislation, to the end that the administration of such legislation shall accomplish substantial justice in all cases expeditiously, inexpensively, and without incumbrance of any character; all of which matters are expressly declared to be the social public policy of this State, binding upon all departments of the state government. The Legislature is vested with plenary powers, to provide for the settlement of any disputes arising under such legislation by arbitration, or by an industrial accident commission, by the courts, or by either, any, or all of these agencies, either separately or in combination, and may fx and control the method and manner of trial of any such dispute, the rules of evidence and the manner of review of decisions rendered by the tribunal or tribunals designated by it; provided, that all decisions of any such tribunal shall be subject to review by the appellate courts of this State. The Legislature may combine in one statute all the provisions for a complete system of workers’ compensation, as herein defned. The Legislature shall have power to provide for the payment of an award to the State in the case of the death, arising out of and in the course of the employment, of an employee without dependents, and such awards may be used for the payment of extra compensation for subsequent injuries beyond the liability of a single employer for awards to employees of the employer. Nothing contained herein shall be taken or construed to impair or render ineffectual in any measure the creation and existence of the industrial accident commission of this State or the state compensation insurance fund, the creation and existence of which, with all the functions vested in them, are hereby ratifed and confrmed.

[Repealed June 8, 1976.] ARTICLE XVI PUBLIC FINANCE [Heading as amended November 5, 1974.] [State Indebtedness—Limitation—Two-thirds Vote to Submit Bond Law— Submission of Law to Electors] SECTION 1. The Legislature shall not, in any manner create any debt or debts, liability or liabilities, which shall, singly or in the aggregate with any previous debts or liabilities, exceed the sum of three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000), except in case of war to repel invasion or suppress in-surrection, unless the same shall be authorized by law for some single ob-ject or work to be distinctly specifed therein which law shall provide ways and means, exclusive of loans, for the payment of the interest of such debt or liability as it falls due, and also to pay and discharge the principal of such debt or liability within 50 years of the time of the contracting thereof, and shall be irrepealable until the principal and interest thereon shall be paid and discharged, and such law may make provision for a sinking fund to pay the principal of such debt or liability to commence at a time after the incurring of such debt or liability of not more than a period of one-fourth of the time of maturity of such debt or liability; but no such law shall take effect unless it has been passed by a two-thirds vote of all the members elected to each house of the Legislature and until, at a general election or at a direct primary, it shall have been submitted to the people and shall have received a majority of all the votes cast for and against it at such elec-tion; and all moneys raised by authority of such law shall be applied only to the specifc object therein stated or to the payment of the debt thereby created. Full publicity as to matters to be voted upon by the people is af-forded by the setting out of the complete text of the proposed laws, togeth-er with the arguments for and against them, in the ballot pamphlet mailed to each elector preceding the election at which they are submitted, and the only requirement for publication of such law shall be that it be set out at length in ballot pamphlets which the Secretary of State shall cause to be printed. The Legislature may, at any time after the approval of such law by the people, reduce the amount of the indebtedness authorized by the law to an amount not less than the amount contracted at the time of the reduc-tion, or it may repeal the law if no debt shall have been contracted in pur-suance thereof. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Constitution, Members of the Legislature who are required to meet with the State Allocation Board shall have equal rights and duties with the nonlegislative members to vote and act upon matters pending or coming before such board for the alloca-tion and apportionment of funds to school districts for school construction purposes or purposes related thereto. Notwithstanding any other provision of this constitution, or of any bond act to the contrary, if any general obligation bonds of the State heretofore or hereafter authorized by vote of the people have been offered for sale and not sold, the Legislature may raise the maximum rate of interest payable on all general obligation bonds authorized but not sold, whether or not such bonds have been offered for sale, by a statute passed by a two-thirds vote of all members elected to each house thereof. The provisions of Senate Bill No. 763 † of the 1969 Regular Session, which authorize an increase of the state general obligation bond maximum interest rate from 5 percent to an amount not in excess of 7 percent and eliminate the maximum rate of interest payable on notes given in anticipa- † Chapter 740. tion of the sale of such bonds, are hereby ratifed.

All property in a redevelopment project established under the Community Redevelopment Law as now existing or hereafter amended, except publicly owned property not subject to taxation by rea-son of that ownership, shall be taxed in proportion to its value as provided in Section 1 of this article, and those taxes (the word “taxes” as used here-in includes, but is not limited to, all levies on an ad valorem basis upon land or real property) shall be levied and collected as other taxes are levied and collected by the respective taxing agencies. The Legislature may provide that any redevelopment plan may contain a provision that the taxes, if any, so levied upon the taxable property in a re-development project each year by or for the beneft of the State of Califor-nia, any city, county, city and county, district, or other public corporation (hereinafter sometimes called “taxing agencies”) after the effective date of the ordinance approving the redevelopment plan, shall be divided as fol-lows: (a) That portion of the taxes which would be produced by the rate upon which the tax is levied each year by or for each of those taxing agencies upon the total sum of the assessed value of the taxable property in the re-development project as shown upon the assessment roll used in connection with the taxation of that property by the taxing agency, last equalized prior to the effective date of the ordinance, shall be allocated to, and when col-lected shall be paid into, the funds of the respective taxing agencies as taxes by or for those taxing agencies on all other property are paid (for the purpose of allocating taxes levied by or for any taxing agency or agencies which did not include the territory in a redevelopment project on the effec-tive date of the ordinance but to which that territory has been annexed or otherwise included after the ordinance’s effective date, the assessment roll of the county last equalized on the effective date of that ordinance shall be used in determining the assessed valuation of the taxable property in the project on that effective date); and (b) Except as provided in subdivision (c), that portion of the levied tax-es each year in excess of that amount shall be allocated to and when col-lected shall be paid into a special fund of the redevelopment agency to pay the principal of and interest on loans, moneys advanced to, or indebtedness (whether funded, refunded, assumed or otherwise) incurred by the rede-velopment agency to fnance or refnance, in whole or in part, the redevel-opment project. Unless and until the total assessed valuation of the taxable property in a redevelopment project exceeds the total assessed value of the taxable property in the project as shown by the last equalized assessment roll referred to in subdivision (a), all of the taxes levied and collected upon the taxable property in the redevelopment project shall be paid into the funds of the respective taxing agencies. When the loans, advances, and in-debtedness, if any, and interest thereon, have been paid, then all moneys thereafter received from taxes upon the taxable property in the redevelop-ment project shall be paid into the funds of the respective taxing agencies as taxes on all other property are paid. (c) That portion of the taxes identifed in subdivision (b) which are at-tributable to a tax rate levied by a taxing agency for the purpose of produc-ing revenues in an amount suffcient to make annual repayments of the principal of, and the interest on, any bonded indebtedness for the acquisi-tion or improvement of real property shall be allocated to, and when col-lected shall be paid into, the fund of that taxing agency. This paragraph shall only apply to taxes levied to repay bonded indebtedness approved by the voters of the taxing agency on or after January 1, 1989. The Legislature may also provide that in any redevelopment plan or in the proceedings for the advance of moneys, or making of loans, or the in-curring of any indebtedness (whether funded, refunded, assumed, or oth-erwise) by the redevelopment agency to fnance or refnance, in whole or in part, the redevelopment project, the portion of taxes identifed in subdi-vision (b), exclusive of that portion identifed in subdivision (c), may be irrevocably pledged for the payment of the principal of and interest on those loans, advances, or indebtedness. It is intended by this section to empower any redevelopment agency, city, county, or city and county under any law authorized by this section to ex-ercise the provisions hereof separately or in combination with powers granted by the same or any other law relative to redevelopment agencies. This section shall not affect any other law or laws relating to the same or a similar subject but is intended to authorize an alternative method of pro-cedure governing the subject to which it refers. The Legislature shall enact those laws as may be necessary to enforce the provisions of this section.

A retirement board’s duty to its participants and their benefciaries shall take precedence over any other duty. (c) The members of the retirement board of a public pension or retire-ment system shall discharge their duties with respect to the system with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then pre-vailing that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with these matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims. (d) The members of the retirement board of a public pension or retire-ment system shall diversify the investments of the system so as to mini-mize the risk of loss and to maximize the rate of return, unless under the circumstances it is clearly not prudent to do so. (e) The retirement board of a public pension or retirement system, con-sistent with the exclusive fduciary responsibilities vested in it, shall have the sole and exclusive power to provide for actuarial services in order to assure the competency of the assets of the public pension or retirement system. (f) With regard to the retirement board of a public pension or retirement system which includes in its composition elected employee members, the number, terms, and method of selection or removal of members of the re-tirement board which were required by law or otherwise in effect on July 1, 1991, shall not be changed, amended, or modifed by the Legislature unless the change, amendment, or modifcation enacted by the Legislature is ratifed by a majority vote of the electors of the jurisdiction in which the participants of the system are or were, prior to retirement, employed. (g) The Legislature may by statute continue to prohibit certain invest-ments by a retirement board where it is in the public interest to do so, and provided that the prohibition satisfes the standards of fduciary care and loyalty required of a retirement board pursuant to this section. (h) As used in this section, the term “retirement board” shall mean the board of administration, board of trustees, board of directors, or other gov-erning body or board of a public employees’ pension or retirement system; provided, however, that the term “retirement board” shall not be interpret-ed to mean or include a governing body or board created after July 1, 1991 which does not administer pension or retirement benefts, or the elected legislative body of a jurisdiction which employs participants in a public employees’ pension or retirement system.

A community of interest is a contiguous population which shares common social and eco-nomic interests that should be included within a single district for purpos-es of its effective and fair representation. Examples of such shared inter-ests are those common to an urban area, a rural area, an industrial area, or an agricultural area, and those common to areas in which the people share similar living standards, use the same transportation facilities, have similar work opportunities, or have access to the same media of communication relevant to the election process. Communities of interest shall not include relationships with political parties, incumbents, or political candidates. (5) To the extent practicable, and where this does not confict with the criteria above, districts shall be drawn to encourage geographical com-pactness such that nearby areas of population are not bypassed for more distant population. (6) To the extent practicable, and where this does not confict with the criteria above, each Senate district shall be comprised of two whole, com-plete, and adjacent Assembly districts, and each Board of Equalization district shall be comprised of 10 whole, complete, and adjacent Senate districts. (e) The place of residence of any incumbent or political candidate shall not be considered in the creation of a map.

Upon approval, the commis-sion shall certify the four fnal maps to the Secretary of State. (h) The commission shall issue, with each of the four fnal maps, a re-port that explains the basis on which the commission made its decisions in achieving compliance with the criteria listed in subdivision (d) and shall include defnitions of the terms and standards used in drawing each fnal map. (i) Each certifed fnal map shall be subject to referendum in the same manner that a statute is subject to referendum pursuant to Section 9 of Ar-ticle II. The date of certifcation of a fnal map to the Secretary of State shall be deemed the enactment date for purposes of Section 9 of Article II. (j) If the commission does not approve a fnal map by at least the requi-site votes or if voters disapprove a certifed fnal map in a referendum, the Secretary of State shall immediately petition the California Supreme Court for an order directing the appointment of special masters to adjust the boundary lines of that map in accordance with the redistricting criteria and requirements set forth in subdivisions (d), (e), and (f). Upon its approval of the masters’ map, the court shall certify the resulting map to the Secre-tary of State, which map shall constitute the certifed fnal map for the sub-ject type of district. [As amended November 2, 2010. Initiative measure.] [Defense of Certifed Final Map] SEC. 3. (a) The commission has the sole legal standing to defend any action regarding a certifed fnal map, and shall inform the Legislature if it determines that funds or other resources provided for the operation of the commission are not adequate. The Legislature shall provide adequate funding to defend any action regarding a certifed map. The commission has sole authority to determine whether the Attorney General or other legal counsel retained by the commission shall assist in the defense of a certifed fnal map. (b) (1) The California Supreme Court has original and exclusive juris-diction in all proceedings in which a certifed fnal map is challenged or is claimed not to have taken timely effect. (2) Any registered voter in this state may fle a petition for a writ of mandate or writ of prohibition, within 45 days after the commission has certifed a fnal map to the Secretary of State, to bar the Secretary of State from implementing the plan on the grounds that the fled plan violates this Constitution, the United States Constitution, or any federal or state statute. Any registered voter in this state may also fle a petition for a writ of man-date or writ of prohibition to seek relief where a certifed fnal map is sub-ject to a referendum measure that is likely to qualify and stay the timely implementation of the map. (3) The California Supreme Court shall give priority to ruling on a peti-tion for a writ of mandate or a writ of prohibition fled pursuant to para-graph (2). If the court determines that a fnal certifed map violates this Constitution, the United States Constitution, or any federal or state statute, the court shall fashion the relief that it deems appropriate, including, but not limited to, the relief set forth in subdivision (j) of Section 2.
